# Intrusion detction in IoT Networks using ML


ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to build an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for IoT networks using XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm. We leverage the RT-IoT2022 dataset, which contains network traffic data from real IoT environments, to classify traffic as normal or attack.

By applying data preprocessing, feature selection, and handling class imbalance, our model improves cybersecurity by accurately detecting cyber threats in IoT systems.

Normalize continuous variables using Min-Max Scaling
Handle missing values efficiently
Handling Imbalanced Data
Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling) to generate synthetic attack samples
Apply undersampling to balance the dataset
Training the XGBoost Model
Optimize model parameters using Grid Search & Random Search
Train XGBoost on the processed dataset
